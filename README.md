# default-node-base
Hello everybody

It was very difficult and time consuming for me when I wanted to run a project with Node, because I had to do the initial project work every time while they were common to all projects.
So I decided to build a base that I could use every time and spend less time on the basics.
I make this site available to everyone so that everyone can use it.

This base includes:
Passport authentication
Error management
Clean coding
MVC architecture
Used .env
Data authentication
Use CSRF for more secure forms
And many other features

Note: There is not much time for APIs in this project and there is another project called "Node-Default-API-Base" on github.
